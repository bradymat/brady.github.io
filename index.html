    <h3>Why are you attending Enspiral Dev Academy?</h3>

    <p>I tried studying Info Tech in 2013 and absolutely loved Web Dev, wasn't really feeling the other subjects so much, some of them were alright but there was no passion there. I was looking for another alternative to study Web Dev because I wasn't willing to try and slug through the other subjects. EDA looked amazing when I first saw it, I did a lot of research on it and decided to move to Wellington to familiarise myself with the city and find good local spots to eat. I'm a vegan so I felt like I need to know some good places to suggest when people want to grab a bite otherwise it can be a bit of a struggle to find a place where everyone is happy to go. Have to be flexible myself but I'd also like to be included. I met with Jamie and talked about the course shortly after I moved to Welly. I've been here about a year now working full time and feel like it's the right time to start.</p>


    <h3>What you learned by reading someone else's blog?</h3>

    <p>I read Lisa and Steve's blogs they share my views on engineering empathy being super important and being confused as to why it isn't implemented at University, especially for team based industries.</p>
    <p>I thought Steve's point about using an Evernote type app to declutter your mind while using the Pomodoro Technique could be really useful. I'll give Pomodoro another shot and try using this during the day and when I am trying to focus on something else while studying.</p>

    <h3>What time are you free?</h3>

    <p>I'm still working full time 10am-7pm Sunday-Thursday and planning to stay working all the way through phase-0, I'm a poor youngling. Most of the times I hang out with people on Saturday but can cancel for EDA stuff of course; this will also probably have to go since I need to keep working. I'll usually have access to Slack so feel free to message me about whatever.</p>
