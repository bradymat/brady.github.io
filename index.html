<h2>Iceland is Beautiful</h2>

<p>The best way to see Iceland is to hop in the car and head out on the Ring Road, the 1337 km road that encircles the island. Just be sure to plan for plenty of extra time along the way for random detours and photo ops. It seems you can't round a corner in Iceland without coming upon sparkling crystal lakes, jagged seaside cliffs, black sand beaches, multi-colored mountains, moss-covered lava fields, half-hidden cave entrances, active volcanoes, glaciers, majestic fjords, sheep and horses grazing by the road, and hundreds upon hundreds of waterfalls, ranging from the faintest trickle to the most powerful gusher in all of Europe. You're going to want to stop along your drive  - and often - to check out the beautiful natural wonders you'll see along the way.</p>
<p>You'll also find plenty of nature right outside Reykjavik. In fact, within an hour or so drive you can see the trifecta - the three attractions of Geysir, Gulfuss and Thingvellir  - that make up the Golden Circle attractions. Watch the earth split apart at Thingvellir, see geysers erupt at Geysir (which no longer erupts, but nearby Strokkur does) and stand in the mist of the thundering Gulfoss waterfall. If you don't want to rent a car, there are dozens of day trips to choose from to get you out of the city and into the wild.</p>
<h2>Iceland is Quirky</h2>

<p>There's no word in the Icelandic language for "please," the Prime Minister's number is in the phone book (listed, like everyone else's, by first name), 20% of the population believes that elves exist, there are more broadband internet connections in Iceland than anywhere else in the world (per capita), 80% of the country's power comes from renewable sources, and earthquakes happen every day. Iceland's got more quirk than it knows what to do with, making for a culture that is a fascinating hodge-podge of startlingly modern and charmingly pastoral. Doubt it? Just check out the video above.</p>
<h2>The Nightlife</h2>

<p>Icelanders say that they drink a lot in winter to make the cold, dark days pass quickly, and that they drink a lot in summer to celebrate the sunshine and long hours of daylight. In short - they drink. A lot. On weekends in Reykjavik, partiers hit the town around 11pm (after pre-gaming at home to save money on the exorbitant cost of liquor) and stay out dancing and drinking until well after 3am. By 4am the streets are packed with post-party revelers, and the line at Baejarins beztu pylsur (the best hot dog stand in town) snakes around the corner. If you haven't partied in Reykjavik, you haven't partied.</p>
