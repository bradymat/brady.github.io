    <h3>Why are you attending Enspiral Dev Academy?</h3>

    <p>I tried studying Info Tech in 2013 and absolutely loved Web Dev, wasn't really feeling the other subjects so much, some of them were alright but there was no passion there. I was looking for another alternative to study Web Dev because I wasn't willing to try and slug through the other subjects. EDA looked amazing when I first saw it, I did a lot of research on it and decided to move to Wellington to familiarise myself with the city and find good local spots to eat. I'm a vegan so I felt like I need to know some good places to suggest when people want to grab a bite otherwise it can be a bit of a struggle to find a place where everyone is happy to go. Have to be flexible myself but I'd also like to be included. I met with Jamie and talked about the course shortly after I moved to Welly. I've been here about a year now working full time and feel like it's the right time to start.</p>


    <h3>What you learned by reading someone else's blog?</h3>

    <p>I read <a href="https://lisa-seeto.github.io/" target="_blank">Lisa's</a> and <a href="http://zimsteve.github.io/" target="_blank">Steve's</a> blogs they share my views on engineering empathy being super important and being confused as to why it isn't implemented at University, especially for team based industries.</p>
    <p>I thought Steve's point about using an Evernote type app to declutter your mind while using the Pomodoro Technique could be really useful. I'll give Pomodoro another shot and try using this during the day and when I am trying to focus on something else while studying.</p>

    <h3>What time are you free?</h3>

    <p>I'm still working full time 10am-7pm Sunday-Thursday and planning to stay working all the way through phase-0, I'm a poor youngling. Most of the times I hang out with people on Saturday but can cancel for EDA stuff of course; this will also probably have to go since I need to keep working. I'll usually have access to Slack so feel free to message me about whatever.</p>

    <h2>Tech Blog Post 2</h2>
      <p class="date" >07/07/2016</p>
      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>It uses a grid (mainly 12 columns 1 row) to easily space elements out on a webpage</p>
      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Responsive webpages will look great on all devices! This is my favourite part of web design. Knowing how much to chage a website to make it work on mobile devices is key. 
      <p>Starting from a mobile design can be a good idea if you want to make the site look more uniform on all devices, although if designed well a site can look pretty different but still recognisable and still be great!</p>
      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure can be refered to as "human-friendly HTML." They are tags that would make sense to anyone like the image tag being "img" or the paragraph tag, "p".
      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>I've always just set up my own grids in the past because I figured using a template is kind of cheating. This is probably really daft thinking, I'll use frameworks from now on it will make things a lot easier for sure - so long as you know how they work!</p>

    <h2>Tech Blog Post 1</h2>
      <p class="date" >07/07/2016</p>
      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>There is that house one but I wasn't too much of a fan of that... I'll come back to this one</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Breaking up all the components of a webpage into boxes! Makes it a lot easier to think about how you will construct it.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>Structuring a page based on a series of boxes</p>

    <h2>First Wishes!</h2>
      <p class="date" >06/07/2016</p>
      <h3>The Wishlist</h3>
      <p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/217/" target="_blank">Zen Garden 217 example</a> - I really like the colours with divs overlaping that have a lower opacity, very cool effect I'll give it a go.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/" target="_blank">Zen Garden 220 example</a> - The 3 columns is a classic, menu on the left hand side vertically looks pretty neat. Something to consider.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a> is one of my favourite websites, love the "coloured filters" over their articles, the fonts are cool and the menus look great. Only thing I have a problem with is the semi boring newspaper type column down the middle with just a bunch of whitespace on later screens, it's fine but I'm not a huge fan.</p>

    <h2>First Post!</h2>
      <p class="date" >30/06/2016</p>
      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>Meditation, mindfulness, pomodoro and timeboxing</p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>I don't think I mashed too well with the pomodoro technique, I tend to want to spend heaps of time on something I enjoy or not want to touch something I'm not enjoying and put the bare minimum into it. </p><p>Maybe if I used to makle myself commit more time to tasks I wasn't enjoying it could be helpful. At the moment though I think stopping on 25 mins is just going to make me lose where I am and frustrate me.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>Meditating before studying after doing other things during the day helped me to get into a calmer zone where I can just work on my study and not focus on anything else, I'll continue to try this for sure.</p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>Meditation, my mother does it a lot and I think I benefited greatly from it, never really given it a shot for some reason despite being prompted to by her quite a few times in the past.</p>

    <h2>First Reflection!</h2>
      <p class="date" >28/06/2016</p>
      <p>Reflections in response to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">video</a> and starting my first week!</p>
    <h3>
      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
    </h3>
      <p>
        It sounds hardcore! It's great that there is a massive emphasis on the team environment and other peoples feelings, very excited to be a part of the course and this industry.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What are your impressions?
    </h3>
      <p>
        We're gonna be busy as heck!
      </p>
    <h3>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h3>
      <p>
        I think I will do great, it's part of the reason I wanted to study at EDA. I think empathy is a great trait and not focused on enough in most businesses.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
    </h3>
      <p>
          I don't think they have changed much, I guess I had a "prepare for the worst" type of ideal heading into this. The video helped a lot I think and answered some very good questioned I didn't think I had. If anything I am less concerned than I was before after watching the video and starting my first week.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    </h3>
      <p>
        I'm definitely very excited. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous that I won't be able to handle doing a lot of hours each week and having no other commitments, but it's a short time right? I'll make it through!
