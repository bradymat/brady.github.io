      <h3>Reflections Blog</h3>
      <p>28/06/2016</p>
      <p>Reflections in response to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" target="_blank">video</a> and starting my first week!</p>
      <h4>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h4>
      <p>It sounds hardcore! It's great that there is a massive emphasis on the team environment and other peoples feelings, very excited to be a part of the course and this industry.</p>
      <h4>What are your impressions?</h4>
      <p>We're gonna be busy as heck!</p>
      <h4>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h4>
      <p>I think I will do great, it's part of the reason I wanted to study at EDA. I think empathy is a great trait and not focused on enough in most businesses.</p>
      <h4>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h4>
      <p>I don't think they have changed much, I guess I had a "prepare for the worst" type of mentality heading into this. The video helped a lot I think and answered some very good questioned I didn't think I had. If anything I am less concerned than I was before after watching the video and starting my first week.</p>
      <h4>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h4>
      <p>I'm definitely very excited. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous that I won't be able to handle doing a lot of hours each week and having no other commitments, but it's a short time right? I'll make it through!</p>
