    <h3>
      What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?
    </h3>
      <p>
        It sounds hardcore! It's great that there is a massive emphasis on the team environment and other peoples feelings, very excited to be a part of the course and this industry.
      </p>
    <h3>
      What are your impressions?
    </h3>
      <p>
        We're gonna be busy as heck!
      </p>
    <h3>
      How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?
    </h3>
      <p>
        I think I will do great, it's part of the reason I wanted to study at EDA. I think empathy is a great trait and not focused on enough in most businesses.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?
    </h3>
      <p>
          I don't think they have changed much, I guess I had a "prepare for the worst" type of ideal heading into this. The video helped a lot I think and answered some very good questioned I didn't think I had. If anything I am less concerned than I was before after watching the video and starting my first week.
      </p>
    <h3>
      Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?
    </h3>
      <p>
        I'm definitely very excited. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little nervous that I won't be able to handle doing a lot of hours each week and having no other commitments, but it's a short time right? I'll make it through!
