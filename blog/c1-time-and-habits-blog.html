      <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>Meditation, mindfulness, pomodoro and timeboxing</p>
      <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>I don't think I mashed too well with the pomodoro technique, I tend to want to spend heaps of time on something I enjoy or not want to touch something I'm not enjoying and put the bare minimum into it. </p><p>Maybe if I used to makle myself commit more time to tasks I wasn't enjoying it could be helpful. At the moment though I think stopping on 25 mins is just going to make me lose where I am and frustrate me.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>Meditating before studying after doing other things during the day helped me to get into a calmer zone where I can just work on my study and not focus on anything else, I'll continue to try this for sure.</p>
      <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>Meditation, my mother does it a lot and I think I benefited greatly from it, never really given it a shot for some reason despite being prompted to by her quite a few times in the past.</p>
