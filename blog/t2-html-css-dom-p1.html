      <h3>The Wishlist</h3>
      <p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/217/" target="_blank">Zen Garden 217 example</a> - I really like the colours with divs overlaping that have a lower opacity, very cool effect I'll give it a go.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/220/" target="_blank">Zen Garden 220 example</a> - The 3 columns is a classic, menu on the left hand side vertically looks pretty neat. Something to consider.</p>
      <p> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/" target="_blank">The Verge</a> is one of my favourite websites, love the "coloured filters" over their articles, the fonts are cool and the menus look great. Only thing I have a problem with is the semi boring newspaper type column down the middle with just a bunch of whitespace on later screens, it's fine but I'm not a huge fan.</p>

    <h2>Tech Blog Post 1</h2>
      <p class="date" >07/07/2016</p>
      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>There is that house one but I wasn't too much of a fan of that... I'll come back to this one</p>
      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Breaking up all the components of a webpage into boxes! Makes it a lot easier to think about how you will construct it.</p>
      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>Structuring a page based on a series of boxes</p>
