    <h3>Time and Habits Blog</h3>
    <p>30/06/2016</p>
    <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h4>
    <p>Meditation, mindfulness, pomodoro and timeboxing</p>
    <h4>What did you find interesting?</h4>
    <p>I don't think I mashed too well with the pomodoro technique, I tend to want to spend heaps of time on something I enjoy or not want to touch something I'm not enjoying and put the bare minimum into it.</p><p>Maybe if I used to makle myself commit more time to tasks I wasn't enjoying it could be helpful. At the moment though I think stopping on 25 mins is just going to make me lose where I am and frustrate me.</p>
    <h4>What worked for you?</h4>
    <p>Meditating before studying after doing other things during the day helped me to get into a calmer zone where I can just work on my study and not focus on anything else, I'll continue to try this for sure.</p>
    <h4>Which will you experiment further with?</h4>
    <p>Meditation, my mother does it a lot and I think I benefited greatly from it, never really given it a shot for some reason despite being prompted to by her quite a few times in the past.</p>
