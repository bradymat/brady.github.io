      <h4>First Chapter -Search Inside Yourself</h4>
      <p>10/07/2016</p>
      <h4> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
      <p>It was fairly introductory I felt that Chade-Meng Tan was really trying to convince us that the book wasn't just about productivity in the work place even though that was a major focus. The parts on mindfulness and how it will improve your life in different scenarios was very interesting.</p>
      <h4>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
      <p>I thought it was great I didn't stop at two mins. It's really important all the time to just say to yourself "this is what I am doing now" otherwise you will always be caught up in the past and the future, thats not to say you can't plan or reflect sometimes! It's just a good skill to be able to bring yourself back to present when you need to be there and focus.</p>
