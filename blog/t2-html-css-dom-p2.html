      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>It uses a grid (mainly 12 columns 1 row) to easily space elements out on a webpage</p>
      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Responsive webpages will look great on all devices! This is my favourite part of web design. Knowing how much to chage a website to make it work on mobile devices is key. 
      <p>Starting from a mobile design can be a good idea if you want to make the site look more uniform on all devices, although if designed well a site can look pretty different but still recognisable and still be great!</p>
      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure can be refered to as "human-friendly HTML." They are tags that would make sense to anyone like the image tag being "img" or the paragraph tag, "p".
      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h3>
      <p>I've always just set up my own grids in the past because I figured using a template is kind of cheating. This is probably really daft thinking, I'll use frameworks from now on it will make things a lot easier for sure - so long as you know how they work!</p>
